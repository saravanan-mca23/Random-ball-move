This HTML and JavaScript code creates an interactive webpage titled "Move balls." It features a container with a white background and a border, within which multiple colorful balls move dynamically. The balls have random starting positions, colors, and velocities, bouncing off the container's edges with a gravity effect. The animation continuously updates every 10 milliseconds, creating a lively and visually engaging display of bouncing balls.
